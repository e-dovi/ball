# Ball
This project was built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It is a simulation of a horizontal movement of a ball at a constant speed. Whenever the ball hits one of the edges, another ball of a random color is generated. After 3.5 seconds, the newly generated balls are reassigned random positions on the page while the initial ball just continues its movement.
